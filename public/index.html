    <p class="special"> Today is my first day of homework and i am not feeling
      too confused and i'll take that as a small win</p>

<h1>My thoughts about history for web design for beginners
  are.</h2>

    <p class="homework">I thought taking the reader
      through the steps of how web
      design has changed throughout the years was cool
      and informative. Especially how things were streamlined.
      Overall i think the article helped me realize how important
      it is for developers to learn
      design and vice versa for designers. It helps to know
      if what you're trying to create works.</p>
