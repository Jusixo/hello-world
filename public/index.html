<h1>My thoughts about history for web design for beginners
  are.</h2>
  <p>I thought taking me through the steps of how web
    design has changed throughout the years was cool
    and informative. Especially how things were streamlined. Overall
  i think the article helped me realize how important it is for developers to learn
design and vice versa for designers. It helps to know
if what you're trying to create works.</p>
